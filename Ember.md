# Embers

Embers are experiences created using NiteFyre's built-in scripting engine. This feature is currently very early in development.
Embers allow users to create customised experiences served by NiteFyre.

The Ember engine uses a combination of an interpreted language which is parsed server side. After processing the Ember can be served to users and access native typescript function on the client.

Plans also include allowing developers to build native applications using angular using an SDK. These will be a single page application which will be integrated into the NiteFyre main client.

More information will appear here as the Ember engine develops.
